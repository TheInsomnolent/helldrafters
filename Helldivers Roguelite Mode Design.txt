Technical Specification: Helldivers 2 Roguelite Companion Application
1. Executive Summary and Project Architecture
1.1 Project Overview
The objective of this technical specification is to define the architecture, database parameters, and algorithmic logic for a companion web application designed to simulate a "Roguelite Mode" for the cooperative shooter Helldivers 2. In the absence of an official endless mode, this application acts as a "Dungeon Master" or "Game Director," strictly controlling the equipment available to players across a linear progression of missions ranging from Difficulty 1 (Trivial) to Difficulty 10 (Super Helldive).
The core gameplay loop proposed involves a "Draft System." Rather than having access to the full armory of Super Earth, players begin with a standardized, low-power loadout. Upon the successful completion of a mission, the application generates a randomized selection of rewards—Primary Weapons, Secondary Weapons, Grenades, Stratagems, or Boosters—from which the player must choose one to upgrade their capability for the subsequent, more difficult mission.
This report provides an exhaustive, deterministic database of all in-game entities as of early 2026, including items from recent Warbonds such as Urban Legends, Truth Enforcers, and Dust Devils.1 Furthermore, it analyzes the "Meta"—the optimal strategies required to defeat specific enemy factions (Terminids, Automatons, and the Illuminate)—to categorize these items into weighted reward pools (Common, Uncommon, Rare). Finally, it details the logic for a "Draft Director" algorithm designed to prevent "soft-locks" (scenarios where a player is statistically incapable of defeating heavy armor) and manage the complexities of 1-4 player squad compositions.
1.2 Architectural Goals
The application must solve three primary design challenges to ensure a viable gameplay experience:
1. Lethality Scaling: The game’s difficulty curve is not linear; it is defined by "Armor Checkpoints." A loadout viable for Difficulty 5 may be mathematically incapable of damaging enemies at Difficulty 6 due to the introduction of Heavy Armor (e.g., Bile Titans, Factory Striders). The draft logic must account for this.
2. Faction Asymmetry: Equipment effectiveness is highly situational. Incendiary weapons dominate Terminids but fail against Automatons. The application must feature "Faction Awareness" to weight draft probabilities appropriately.
3. User Progression Synchronization: Players possess different unlock states in the actual game. The application must include a "Reroll/Lock" mechanism to handle items the user has not yet acquired in Helldivers 2, preventing the frustration of drafting an unusable card.

2. Comprehensive Entity Database: The Armory
To function as a deterministic system, the application requires a complete index of all variable player equipment. This section details every available item, analyzing its mechanical function and strategic value within a Roguelite context.
2.1 Primary Weapons Database
The Primary Weapon is the player's principal tool for engagement. In a draft scenario, the transition from a starter weapon to a specialized primary is often the most significant power spike a player experiences.
2.1.1 Assault Rifles
Assault rifles provide versatility but often lack the specialized damage output required for high-difficulty elites.
* AR-23 Liberator: The baseline standard. Balanced recoil (15) and fire rate (640 RPM). Effective against "chaff" (Scavengers, Troopers) but struggles against Hive Guards or Devastators due to light armor penetration.3
* AR-23P Liberator Penetrator: A modification of the base platform offering Medium Armor Penetration. This allows it to damage Automaton Devastators through their chest plates, a critical capability in mid-tier difficulty. The trade-off is a smaller magazine and lower raw damage per bullet.
* AR-23C Liberator Concussive: Fires explosive rounds with high stagger value. While its DPS is low, its utility in a Roguelite run is high for crowd control, pushing back Stalkers or Berserkers to buy breathing room for teammates.
* AR-23A Liberator Carbine: A high-RPM variant with significant recoil. It functions closer to an SMG, best used for close-quarters "panic fire" against Hunter packs.
* AR-61 Tenderizer: High caliber, high accuracy, but limited ammunition capacity. Best suited for bots where headshots are prioritized.
* BR-14 Adjudicator: A heavy battle rifle with medium penetration. It bridges the gap between assault rifles and marksman rifles but suffers from intense recoil, requiring controlled bursts.
* StA-52 Assault Rifle: Introduced in the Truth Enforcers Warbond.4 A high-capacity rifle designed for sustained suppression fire.
* MA5C Assault Rifle: A collaborative weapon (referencing Halo ODST). Reliable mid-range performance with no attachment options, limiting its scaling potential in the late game.3
* AR-2 Coyote: A specialized rifle that applies a burning effect. This weapon is Tier S against Terminids and the Illuminate "Fleshmobs" due to biological vulnerability to fire.3
* AR/GL-21 One-Two: A hybrid weapon featuring an under-barrel grenade launcher. This provides immense utility, allowing the user to close bug holes or destroy fabricators without consuming grenade slots or stratagems.3
2.1.2 Shotguns
Shotguns are currently the dominant "Meta" choice for Terminid and Illuminate fronts due to the game's emphasis on close-range swarm management.
* SG-8 Punisher: A pump-action shotgun with massive stagger force. It reloads round-by-round, ensuring the player is never truly "empty." It stops Stalkers dead in their tracks.
* SG-8S Slugger: Fires a single high-mass slug. It possesses Medium Armor Penetration and high structure damage, capable of breaking fences and container doors. A "Rare" tier pick for its versatility.
* SG-225 Breaker: An automatic shotgun with high DPS. Formerly the undisputed king of weapons, it remains a strong "Uncommon" pick for burst damage.
* SG-225SP Breaker Spray & Pray: A variant with a drum magazine and birdshot. It lacks penetration, making it useless against armor, but it clears Shrieker flocks and Hunter swarms instantly.
* SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary: The premier anti-bug weapon. It covers a wide area in fire, allowing the player to fire into a breach and walk away as the enemies burn to death. Essential for Difficulty 9+ Terminid runs.3
* SG-8P Punisher Plasma: Fires lobbed plasma rounds that explode on impact. This weapon effectively counters Automaton Scout Striders and Shield Devastators by splashing damage around their frontal defense.
* SG-451 Cookout: A pump-action incendiary shotgun. It combines the stagger of the Punisher with the fire damage of the Incendiary Breaker, making it a top-tier defensive tool.3
* SG-20 Halt: A stun-focused shotgun. It deals low damage but applies an EMS-like slowing effect, crucial for managing the speed of Illuminate units.3
* M90A Shotgun: A high-damage pump-action shotgun (ODST variant). Simple, kinetic, effective.
2.1.3 Energy-Based Weapons
Energy weapons theoretically offer infinite ammunition if heat is managed, a massive advantage in Roguelite runs where supply drops may be scarce or contested.
* LAS-5 Scythe: A continuous beam weapon. It has zero recoil and perfect accuracy but low DPS. It requires precise tracking of weak points (heads/limbs).
* LAS-16 Sickle: An energy machine gun with a short spin-up time. It is arguably the best all-around primary for prolonged engagements due to its near-infinite ammo economy.3
* LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle: A heavier variant with higher penetration but faster heat accumulation.
* PLAS-1 Scorcher: Fires explosive plasma bolts. It is unique in that it is a "primary" that acts like a light anti-tank weapon, destroying Scout Striders and damaging Heavy Devastators through their shields.
* PLAS-101 Purifier: A charge-up weapon. The player must hold the trigger to build a powerful plasma shot. High damage, high risk.
* PLAS-39 Accelerator Rifle: A sniper-configured plasma weapon. It offers the range of a DMR with the explosive utility of energy weapons.3
* ARC-12 Blitzer: Fires a spread of electrical arcs. It requires no aim, automatically targeting enemies in a cone. It has infinite ammo and high stagger, making it excellent for "kiting" enemies.3
2.1.4 Marksman Rifles
Required for high-difficulty Automaton play to eliminate Devastators from a distance before they can suppress the squad with rocket fire.
* R-63 Diligence: The standard DMR. Good handling, decent capacity.
* R-63CS Diligence Counter Sniper: High damage, high scope sway. It is the only primary capable of one-shotting a Devastator to the head from extreme range.
* R-36 Eruptor: A bolt-action rifle firing rocket-propelled shrapnel. It deals explosive damage and can destroy fabricators and bug holes. It is essentially a support weapon in the primary slot, but it has a very slow cycle rate.3
* CB-9 Explosive Crossbow: Fires silent, explosive bolts. It allows for stealth gameplay and closes holes. One-handed, meaning it can be used with a Ballistic Shield.
* R-2124 Constitution: A bolt-action/lever-action rifle. High damage per shot but abysmal fire rate. Mostly a "challenge" item or a "Common" tier draft pick for early levels.
2.1.5 Submachine Guns
SMGs enable one-handed operation, allowing players to fire while carrying objective items (SSDs, Artillery Shells) or while using a Ballistic Shield.
* MP-98 Knight: An extremely high rate of fire (1380 RPM). It shreds enemies at close range but empties its magazine in one second.
* SMG-37 Defender: A slow-firing, hard-hitting SMG. It functions like a compact assault rifle and pairs perfectly with the Ballistic Shield against bots.
* SMG-72 Pummeler: Fires concussive rounds that stun-lock enemies. This allows a player to freeze a Stalker or Berserker in place while teammates finish it.
* SMG-32 Reprimand: A heavy caliber SMG with increased stopping power.
* StA-11 SMG: A standard-issue submachine gun offering a middle ground between the Knight and Defender.
* M7S SMG: A silenced SMG (ODST). Useful if stealth mechanics are leveraged in the run.3
________________
2.2 Secondary Weapons Database
In a drafting system, the secondary weapon covers the tactical gaps left by the primary.
* P-2 Peacemaker: The starting pistol. Reliable but low power.
* P-19 Redeemer: A machine pistol with extreme DPS. It is the panic button for when hunters get too close.
* P-4 Senator: A heavy revolver with Medium Armor Penetration. It can kill elite enemies but requires a slow, round-by-round reload.
* GP-31 Grenade Pistol: A single-shot grenade launcher. It is a utility tool for closing bug holes, allowing the player to run Stun Grenades in their grenade slot.
* LAS-7 Dagger: A laser pistol. Low damage, but infinite ammo. Good for clearing mines or small scavengers.
* P-113 Verdict: A heavy semi-auto pistol, hitting harder than the Peacemaker.
* SG-22 Bushwhacker: A triple-barrel sawed-off shotgun. It offers a "Get Off Me" pushback capability.
* Crisper: A handheld flamethrower. It allows for retreating fire, setting the ground ablaze to slow pursuers.
* P-43 Stim Pistol: A support tool that fires healing darts at teammates. In a 4-player draft, this enables a "Healer" archetype.5
________________
2.3 Grenades Database
Grenades are finite resources that solve geometry or armor problems.
* G-12 High Explosive: Standard fuse. High damage, destroys structures.
* G-6 Frag: Larger blast radius, lower armor penetration. Good for clearing light patrols.
* G-16 Impact: Detonates on contact. Essential for killing Bile Spewers instantly or hitting tank vents. Cannot destroy fabricators unless thrown through the door/vent perfectly.
* G-23 Stun: Zero damage, massive stun radius. It freezes Chargers, Hulks, and groups of enemies for several seconds. It is the "Meta" pick for high-level play to set up precision strikes.
* G-10 Incendiary: Covers an area in fire (DoT).
* G-13 Incendiary Impact: Instant fire detonation.
* G-3 Smoke: Creates a visual obscurement cloud. Essential for breaking line-of-sight against Automaton gunships or heavy patrols.
* Thermite Grenade: Sticks to armor and burns at extreme temperatures. Capable of destroying heavy tanks and Hulk armor over time.
* Gas Grenade: Releases a corrosive cloud that damages and confuses enemies.
* Throwing Knife: High damage, silent, reusable if retrieved. Penetrates medium armor if hitting weak spots.
________________
2.4 Stratagems Database
Stratagems are the "Power Cards" of the Roguelite deck. They are categorized by their deployment vector and cooldown mechanics.6
2.4.1 Orbital Cannons

3. Threat Analysis and Difficulty Scaling
To build the "Roguelite" progression, the application must understand what "Difficulty" actually means in Helldivers 2. It is not just "more health"; it is the introduction of specific armor tiers that invalidate certain weapons.8
3.1 The Difficulty Progression (1-10)


Difficulty Level
	Name
	Key Threat Introduction
	Minimum Equipment Requirement
	1
	Trivial
	Scavengers, Troopers
	Any Primary
	2
	Easy
	Warriors, Raiders
	Light Penetration
	3
	Medium
	Hive Guards / Scout Striders
	Medium Pen or Precision
	4
	Challenging
	Chargers / Hulks
	Anti-Tank (AT) or Stun+Flank
	5
	Hard
	Bile Titans / Tanks
	Heavy AT Stratagems
	6
	Extreme
	Massive Swarms, Impalers
	Crowd Control + Heavy AT
	7
	Suicide
	Factory Striders / Titan Packs
	High Efficiency Meta Loadouts
	8
	Impossible
	Alpha Commanders / Rocket Striders
	Optimized Synergy
	9
	Helldive
	Relentless Aggression
	Mastery of mechanics
	10
	Super Helldive
	Mega Nests / Fortresses / Hive Lords
	380mm Barrage / Nuke capabilities 9
	Insight for the App Logic: The "Draft Director" must track the player's "Armor Solution Capability."
* If the player reaches Difficulty 4 without drafting an EAT-17, Recoilless, Quasar, or Railcannon, they are statistically likely to fail against a Charger or Hulk.
* Logic Rule: If Current_Diff >= 3 AND Player_AT_Score == 0, the next Draft must offer an Anti-Tank card in the "Rare" slot to prevent a soft-lock.
3.2 Faction Intelligence
The application must allow users to select the Campaign Faction before the run starts, as this drastically alters the value of items.
3.2.1 The Terminids (Bugs)
* Characteristics: Melee swarms, rapid closure, biological armor.
* Draft Priority:
   * Fire: Incendiary Breaker, Napalm Eagle, Gas Strike.
   * Rovers: The Laser Drone clears hunters automatically.
   * Anti-Tank: Chargers require leg-stripping (Flamethrower/Railgun) or headshots (Quasar/EAT).
3.2.2 The Automatons (Bots)
* Characteristics: Ranged projectile fire, heavy armor plating, air support (Gunships).
* Draft Priority:
   * Cover: Shield Generator Backpack is top tier to prevent "aim punch" from incoming fire.
   * Precision: Autocannon, AMR, and Diligence CS are required to hit small weak points (eyes/vents). Fire is less effective.
   * Explosive Resistance: The Vitality Booster is critical to surviving rocket splash damage.
3.2.3 The Illuminate (Squids)
* Characteristics: Energy shields, teleportation, confusion tactics, electrical attacks.10
* Enemy Types: Fleshmob (chaff), Watcher (stealth/detection), Overseer (elite), Tripods.
* Draft Priority:
   * Volume of Fire: Shields regenerate. Continuous damage (Sickle, Gatling Sentry) prevents regen.
   * Stagger: Punisher Plasma or Concussive weapons disrupt their casting/teleport animations.
   * Mobility: Jetpacks or Stamina boosters are needed to escape containment fields or walls.
   * Stratagem Jamming: Illuminate can jam stratagems. Reliance on support weapons (held items) is safer than reliance on Orbitals.12
________________
4. The Roguelite Draft Engine
This section details the algorithmic logic for the webapp. The goal is to simulate a fair but challenging progression.
4.1 The Core Loop
The application manages a RunState object containing:
* Current_Diff (Int 1-10)
* Loadout (Array of equipped IDs)
* Inventory (Array of unlocked IDs for this run)
* Requisition_Points (Currency for rerolls)
Flow:
1. Initialization: Player selects Faction. App assigns Starter_Loadout (Liberator, Peacemaker, HE Grenade, Precision Strike, MG-43).
2. Mission Phase: Player plays the actual game at Current_Diff.
3. Result Phase: Player reports "Success" or "Failure" to the app.
   * Success: Earn 1 Requisition Point. Proceed to Draft.
   * Failure: Lose 1 "Life" (Draft opportunity). If Lives > 0, retry diff. If Lives = 0, Game Over.
4. Draft Phase: App generates 3 Cards based on Reward_Pools.
5. Selection: Player picks 1 card.
   * If the card is a new category (e.g., Backpack) and the slot is empty -> Equip.
   * If the slot is full -> Prompt to "Replace" or "Stash" (Stashed items can be swapped in between missions).
4.2 Reward Pools and Rarity Logic
To balance the game, we assign "Rarity" to items based on their Meta Power Level.
* Draw Weights:
   * Common: 60% chance.
   * Uncommon: 30% chance.
   * Rare: 10% chance.
Table 4.1: The Deterministic Reward Pools (Sample Integration)

	Neutral
	Legendary
	Massive power spike. Rare only at Diff 7+.
	4.3 The "Draft Director" Logic (Anti-Weird Draw)
The user specifically requested avoiding "weird draws like 3 secondaries." The app requires a filtering algorithm.
Algorithm: generate_hand(player_state)
1. Fetch Candidates: Pull all items from the master DB.
2. Filter 1: Unlocks: Remove items the user has globally marked as "Not Unlocked" (Warbonds).
3. Filter 2: Duplicates: Remove items currently in the player's Inventory.
4. Filter 3: Composition Rules (The "Smart" Layer):
   * Rule A: A hand of 3 cards cannot contain more than 1 Secondary Weapon.
   * Rule B: A hand cannot contain more than 1 Backpack if the player already has a Backpack equipped.
   * Rule C: If Player.Stratagem_Count < 4, boost Stratagem weight by 2x.
   * Rule D: If Current_Diff > 5 and Player.Has_AntiTank == False, Override Slot 3 to force an Anti-Tank tag item (EAT, Quasar, Recoilless).
5. Selection: Randomly select 3 items based on Rarity weights.
6. Render: Display cards to user.
4.4 Multiplayer Synergy Logic (1-4 Players)
If the app is set to "Squad Mode," the draft needs to account for the team.
* Shared Pool Draft: Instead of 1 player drafting 1 card, the squad generates a pool of 4 + (Player_Count) cards.
* Draft Pick: Players take turns picking from the pool.
* Synergy Injection:
   * If Player A drafts a Recoilless Rifle, the Draft Director increases the probability of a Supply Pack appearing in the next round for Player B (Team Reload synergy).
   * If the team lacks a Booster, the Director forces a Booster into the pool every 3 levels.
   * The "Support" Role: The app should recognize roles. If a player picks the Stim Pistol or Supply Pack, the app tags them as "Support" and offers them smoke/EMS stratagems more frequently.
________________
5. Meta-Analysis: Constructing the Tiers
To populate the Common/Uncommon/Rare tables effectively, we must define the "Meta" as of 2026.
5.1 Common Tier (The "Workhorses")
These items are reliable but not game-breaking. They form the backbone of a run.
* Weapons: Liberator, Defender, Punisher, Peacemaker.
* Stratagems: MG-43, Gatling Barrage, Airburst, Gas Strike, Machine Gun Sentry.
* Boosters: UAV Recon, Reinforcement Budget.
5.2 Uncommon Tier (The "Problem Solvers")
These items solve specific tactical problems (armor, holes, swarms).
* Weapons: Breaker, Slugger, Dominator, Diligence CS, Senator, Grenade Pistol.
* Stratagems: Eagle Airstrike, Cluster Bomb, Autocannon, EAT-17, Recoilless, Mortar Sentry, EMS Mortar.
* Boosters: Vitality, Muscle Enhancement, Localization Confusion.
5.3 Rare Tier (The "Carry" Cards)
These items can single-handedly save a run or delete the hardest enemies.
* Weapons: Scorcher, Incendiary Breaker, Sickle, Plasma Punisher, Eruptor, Blitzer.
* Stratagems: Railcannon Strike, Orbital Laser, 500kg Bomb, Quasar Cannon, Shield Generator Pack, Spear, Exosuits (Mechs).
* Boosters: Stamina Enhancement, Hellpod Space Optimization, Experimental Infusion.
________________
6. Application Logic and User Interface
6.1 State Management & Rerolling
The app must handle the user's collection state.
* "My Armory" Feature: On first launch, the user sees a list of all Warbonds (e.g., Steeled Veterans, Cutting Edge, Urban Legends). They toggle "OFF" the ones they haven't bought.
   * Logic: Items from disabled Warbonds are removed from the master Candidate_List permanently.
* In-Run Rerolls:
   * Requisition Reroll: Spend 1 Requisition Point (earned by clearing missions) to discard the current hand of 3 cards and draw 3 new ones.
   * The "Not Unlocked" Exception: Even with the Armory feature, a user might unlock a Warbond but not the specific page. If a card appears that the user physically cannot equip in-game, they press a specific "Not Unlocked" button. This rerolls that single card for free and blacklists it for the rest of the session.
6.2 The User Interface (UI) Flow
1. Dashboard: Shows "Current Difficulty: 6 (Extreme)".
2. Loadout Visualizer: A grid showing Primary, Secondary, Grenade, Armor Passive (Generic), and 4 Stratagems.
3. Draft Screen: Appears after "Complete Mission" is clicked.
   * Visuals: 3 Cards styled like Helldivers requisitions (Yellow/Black aesthetic).
   * Stats: Hovering over a card shows "DPS," "Armor Pen," and "Cooldown."
4. Synergy Tips: If a player drafts the Spear, the UI displays a tip: "Synergy Tip: Draft a Scout Armor or Smoke to facilitate lock-ons."
________________
7. Future Proofing and Warbond Integration
The database is designed to be extensible. As new Warbonds release (e.g., the rumored Python Commandos 1), the administrator simply adds the new items to the JSON database with three tags:
1. Type (Primary/Stratagem/etc.)
2. Rarity (Based on initial meta assessment).
3. Faction_Strength (Does it burn? Does it penetrate armor?).
The Draft Director algorithm does not need to change; it simply ingests the new IDs into the existing logic pools.
8. Conclusion
This specification provides a complete roadmap for building the Helldivers 2 Roguelite Companion. By combining a deterministic database of all weapons and stratagems with a sophisticated "Draft Director" that understands the nuances of armor penetration and faction lethality, the application can generate a highly replayable and strategic layer over the base game. The logic detailed here ensures that while the draft is random, it is never "unfair" in a way that breaks the game mechanics—guaranteeing that every Helldiver has a fighting chance to spread Managed Democracy, one drafted loadout at a time.
